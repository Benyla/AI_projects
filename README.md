# AI-projects
This folder currently includes 4 main project(s):
- Grassmann Clustering: This project investigates the use of Grassmann Clustering (GC) and Weighted Grassmann Clustering (WGC), to analyzing sleep data from fMRI measurements.
- Linear Regression: In this project, I used a simple logistic regression model to classify handwritten digits (0 and 1).
- 02450 - Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining: Implementation of various machine learning models, cross-validation, and statistical evaluation.
- NN: In this project i implemented a basic neural network from scratch using numpy. I followed a toturial, so only some of the code is written by me. Could be interesting to compare the speed to a highly optimized lib like tensorflow
