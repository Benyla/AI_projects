# AI-projects
This folder currently includes 2 main project(s):
- Grassmann Clustering: This project investigates the use of Grassmann Clustering (GC) and Weighted Grassmann Clustering (WGC), to analyzing sleep data from fMRI measurements.
- Linear Regression: In this project, I used a simple logistic regression model to classify handwritten digits (0 and 1).
