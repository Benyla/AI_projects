### 02450 - Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining

This project was completed in collaboration with two other DTU students. 
Our goal was to use various machine learning models to predict whether a person is a smoker based on a range of features.

We applied cross-validation across all models to achieve more reliable accuracy estimates. 
Additionally, statistical evaluation methods were used to compare the performance of the models.
